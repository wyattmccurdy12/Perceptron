# Perceptron

This code is copied from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVzNd5Xo3fM and the previous videos from Computer Vision Lab.

Changes have been made, such as docstrings, private variables, extra optional transform functions, etc.
The neuron class will also take a text file with an n-dimensional input and a 1-dimensional target/actual class.

The "Adder" class provides additional functionality - showing the fundamental power of a "neuron" to perform basic operations. I implemented the adder shown in [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). From the book: "The adder example demonstrates how a network of perceptrons can be used to simulate a circuit containing many NAND gates. And because NAND gates are universal for computation, it follows that perceptrons are also universal for computation." 
Basic, but ##VERY COOL!
